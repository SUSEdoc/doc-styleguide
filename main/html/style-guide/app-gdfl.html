    Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA
  </p><p>
    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
    license document, but changing it is not allowed.
  </p><section class="sect1" id="id-1.17.6" data-id-title="PREAMBLE"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><div class="title-container"><h2 class="title legal"><span class="title-number-name"><span class="title-name">PREAMBLE</span></span> <a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="app-gdfl.html#id-1.17.6">#</a></h2><div class="icons"><a target="_blank" class="icon-reportbug" title="Report an issue"> </a></div></div></div></div></div><p>
      The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
      functional and useful document “free” in the sense of
      freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and
      redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or
      noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and
      publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered
      responsible for modifications made by others.
    </p><p>
      This License is a kind of <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">copyleft</span>”</span>, which means that
      derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same
      sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
      license designed for free software.
    </p><p>
      We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
      software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program
      should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software
      does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used
      for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is
      published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for
      works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
    </p></section><section class="sect1" id="id-1.17.7" data-id-title="APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><div class="title-container"><h2 class="title legal"><span class="title-number-name"><span class="title-name">APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</span></span> <a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="app-gdfl.html#id-1.17.7">#</a></h2><div class="icons"><a target="_blank" class="icon-reportbug" title="Report an issue"> </a></div></div></div></div></div><p>
      This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
      contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
      distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a
      world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work
      under the conditions stated herein. The <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Document</span>”</span>, below,
      refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a
      licensee, and is addressed as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">you</span>”</span>. You accept the license
      if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
      under copyright law.
    </p><p>
      A <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Modified Version</span>”</span> of the Document means any work
      containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or
      with modifications and/or translated into another language.
    </p><p>
      A <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Secondary Section</span>”</span> is a named appendix or a front-matter
      section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of
      the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall
      subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
      directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a
      textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
      mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection
      with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
      philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.
    </p><p>
      The <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Invariant Sections</span>”</span> are certain Secondary Sections
      whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
      notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a
      section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
      allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero
      Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant
      Sections then there are none.
    </p><p>
      The <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Cover Texts</span>”</span> are certain short passages of text that
      are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that
      says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text
      may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
    </p><p>
      A <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Transparent</span>”</span> copy of the Document means a
      machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is
      available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the
      document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
      composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
      available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
      formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable
      for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent
      file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to
      thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not
      Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any
      substantial amount of text. A copy that is not <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Transparent</span>”</span>
      is called <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Opaque</span>”</span>.
    </p><p>
      Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
      without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML
      using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
      PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of
      transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats
      include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
      proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
      processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated
      HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output
      purposes only.
    </p><p>
      The <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Title Page</span>”</span> means, for a printed book, the title page
      itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
      material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in
      formats which do not have any title page as such, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Title
      Page</span>”</span> means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
      work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
    </p><p>
      A section <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Entitled XYZ</span>”</span> means a named subunit of the
      Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in
      parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here
      XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Acknowledgements</span>”</span>, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Dedications</span>”</span>,
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Endorsements</span>”</span>, or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">History</span>”</span>.) To
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Preserve the Title</span>”</span> of such a section when you modify the
      Document means that it remains a section <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Entitled XYZ</span>”</span>
      according to this definition.
    </p><p>
      The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
      states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty
      Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License,
      but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that
      these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the
      meaning of this License.
    </p></section><section class="sect1" id="id-1.17.8" data-id-title="VERBATIM COPYING"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><div class="title-container"><h2 class="title legal"><span class="title-number-name"><span class="title-name">VERBATIM COPYING</span></span> <a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="app-gdfl.html#id-1.17.8">#</a></h2><div class="icons"><a target="_blank" class="icon-reportbug" title="Report an issue"> </a></div></div></div></div></div><p>
      You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
      commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
      copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to
      the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
      conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical
      measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the
      copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in
      exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies
      you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
    </p><p>
      You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you
      may publicly display copies.
    </p></section><section class="sect1" id="id-1.17.9" data-id-title="COPYING IN QUANTITY"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><div class="title-container"><h2 class="title legal"><span class="title-number-name"><span class="title-name">COPYING IN QUANTITY</span></span> <a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="app-gdfl.html#id-1.17.9">#</a></h2><div class="icons"><a target="_blank" class="icon-reportbug" title="Report an issue"> </a></div></div></div></div></div><p>
      If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
      printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
      Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
      the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
      Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the
      back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the
      publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title
      with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add
      other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to
      the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
      satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other
      respects.
    </p><p>
      If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly,
      you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the
      actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.
    </p><p>
      If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more
      than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy
      along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
      computer-network location from which the general network-using public has
      access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete
      Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the
      latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
      distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
      Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until
      at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy
      (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the
      public.
    </p><p>
      It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
      Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
      them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
    </p></section><section class="sect1" id="id-1.17.10" data-id-title="MODIFICATIONS"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><div class="title-container"><h2 class="title legal"><span class="title-number-name"><span class="title-name">MODIFICATIONS</span></span> <a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="app-gdfl.html#id-1.17.10">#</a></h2><div class="icons"><a target="_blank" class="icon-reportbug" title="Report an issue"> </a></div></div></div></div></div><p>
      You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
      conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the
      Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version
      filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and
      modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.
      In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
    </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">A.</span>
        Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from
        that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which
        should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the
        Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the
        original publisher of that version gives permission.
      </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">B.</span>
        List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
        responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
        Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
        Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
        unless they release you from this requirement.
      </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">C.</span>
        State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified

        These may be placed in the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">History</span>”</span> section. You may omit
        a network location for a work that was published at least four years

      If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices
      that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from
      the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these
      sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of
      Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s license notice. These
      titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
    </p><p>
      You may add a section Entitled <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Endorsements</span>”</span>, provided it
      contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
      parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been
      approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
      standard.
    </p><p>
      You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
      passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of
      Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text
      and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made
      by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the
      same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same
      entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
      replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher
      that added the old one.
    </p><p>
      The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
      give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
      imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

      You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
      License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
      versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
      Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list
      them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license
      notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
    </p><p>
      The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
      multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy.
      If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different
      contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end
      of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of
      that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment
      to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license
      notice of the combined work.
    </p><p>
      In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">History</span>”</span> in the various original documents, forming one

      License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
      the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
      verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
    </p><p>
      You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute

      A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
      independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
      distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the
      copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal
      rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works
      permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does
      not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
      derivative works of the Document.
    </p><p>
      If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies
      of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire
      aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that
      bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent
      of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must
      appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.

      Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
      translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing
      Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from
      their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all
      Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these
      Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and
      all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers,
      provided that you also include the original English version of this
      License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In
      case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version
      of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
      prevail.
    </p><p>
      If a section in the Document is Entitled <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Acknowledgements</span>”</span>,
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Dedications</span>”</span>, or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">History</span>”</span>, the requirement
      (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require
      changing the actual title.

      The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU

    </p><p>
      Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If
      the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">or any later version</span>”</span> applies to it, you have the option of
      following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of

      To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the
      License in the document and put the following copyright and license
      notices just after the title page:
    </p><div class="verbatim-wrap"><pre class="screen">Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME.
Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2

with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
A copy of the license is included in the section entitled “GNU
Free Documentation License”.</pre></div><p>
      If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
      replace the “with...Texts.” line with this:
    </p><div class="verbatim-wrap"><pre class="screen">with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the

      If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
      combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
      situation.
    </p><p>
      If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
      recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
      software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their
      use in free software.
